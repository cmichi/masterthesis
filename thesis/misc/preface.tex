This thesis is my own work, but without the discussions with friends and
appropriate feedback it would certainly be in a different shape.\\

\noindent{}Firstly, I want to thank my advisor \emph{Benjamin Erb} for 
coming up with the initial idea and his in every way valuable advice. 
Our discussions have been an opportunity for me to reflect on ideas and 
conceptual considerations. Without those, the results in this thesis would 
surely differ.\\ 

\noindent{}The remarks by \emph{Markus Schnalke} provided great feedback of 
a reader unfamiliar with the topic. Thank you, Markus.\\ 

\noindent{}\emph{Katja Rogers} had a look at the thesis and provided valuable 
suggestions on language and style. Thanks, Kate.\\ 

\noindent{}The group meetings of the \emph{Chronograph research group} 
provided a forum for discussing ideas. \emph{Gerhard Habiger} provided further 
valuable suggestions. Thank~you~all.\\ 

\noindent{}Last, \emph{Valerie} deserves recognition for her support and 
understanding. Something that is equally important as technical advice.
